Why Supply Chain Management?
Technological advancements are making the mankind achieve many things just by the click of a
button, having internet connectivity and a smart phone can make almost everything possible
these days. One of the many possibilities is E-commerce industry, of which supply chain is a part.
One can order food, clothes, home needs, literally anything which can be delivered to the
doorstep in a much efficient way, at a much cheaper rate yet maintaining the quality. Nowadays,
innovation and research have become major asset for improving performance and sustainability
of supply chain. Needing for manage, design and operate these complex supply chain globally
continues to grow. Hence, Supply chain is the art of science of getting products from
manufacturers to customers.
There are few factors among many, have influenced us to take up this project and try to address
the issues highlighted below.
 No Time Management/No On-time delivery
 Not educating Distributors and other Stake-holders
 Not providing concise & informative data to the delivery agents
 Not Keeping-up with changes in Technology

Objective:
Supply Chain globally is very heterogeneous and each stakeholder produces and receives a
massive amount of structured and unstructured data in real-time, which are generated either by
humans or by information technology or other stakeholders. In this project, we attempt to identify
the current challenges and integration issues between stakeholders by developing a prototype of
Supply Chain Management, providing a holistic view, addressing and Optimizing the issues faced
by Stakeholders involved in the entire Supply Chain.

The Method used for fetching data from different database is done by using queries and then data is used in the application for further transformation. Different python libraries are used like matplotlib for plotting graph, Pandas for Data frame manipulation and Regex for Regular Expression. Pymongo is used for MongoDB integration, Py2neo is used for Neo4j and python Redis is used for Redis integration of database layer with the Application layer. Geopy library is used to find the distance between the two latitude and longitude values. It calculates the geodesic distance between two points. Json library is used to convert the dictionary into json format by using json.dump
